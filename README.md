# UPDATE
Now working in Blender 2.80

# Pixeler
Pixels to planes Blender Plugin. Install or copy into the addons folder.

# Usage
Add an image data block to your .blend and specify the name (e.g. image.png) in the "Image Name" input field. The default x and y offset (2) will create a continuous plane of plane meshes with respective PBR materials of the pixels colour.

# Further information
can be found in the system console while running the function. Reasonable file sizes and restricted colour palettes are recommended. 1000*1000 pixels is the tested working limit. Alpha channel transparency (=0) is supported.
